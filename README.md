# 2000-2015 HPCA/ISCA/MICRO Co-author Graph

This is an interactive visualization of coauthor graph in computer architecture research. The publication data was from the DBLP dataset and was parsed and prepared by Diyu Zhou. The visualization was implemented by Yuchen Hao using R, Gephi and an export plugin provided by the Oxford Internet Institute.

This was originally a class project for CS246: Web Information Management at UCLA taught by Professor John Cho. We hope that the project can also be useful in academic research.

The following link showcase the visualization effect.
